## Supporting Fast Iteration in Model Building
- Although the modeling process is iterative, current tolls are optimized for individual models as opposed to modeling sessions.
- The primary goals of a system optimized for iteration are two fold:
	- make it cheap to run modeling experiments (with respect to time and computation)
	- provide means to manage the process by tracking experiments and allowing meta-analysis
