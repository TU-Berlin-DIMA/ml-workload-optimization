"""
Checking the Reuse and Warm-starting correctness
Use Cases:
UC 1:
    1. Load data
    2. chain 2 data transformation and a model training
    3. store the graph
    4. open a new workload
    5. load the history graph
    6. write the exact same transformations and model training
    7. the model should be fetched from the history graph instead being executed
UC 2:
    1. Load data
    2. chain 2 data transformation and a model training
    3. store the graph
    4. open a new workload
    5. load the history graph
    6. write the exact same transformations but a different model training procedure
    7. the data after the second transformation should be fetched from the history and only the model training
       should be executed

UC 3:
    workloads with forks and merges

UC 4:
    (After implementing the concept of materialization algorithms)
    history graph with partial materialized nodes
