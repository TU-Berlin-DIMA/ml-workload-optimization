\subsection{Materialization of Transformed Data}\label{sub-sec-materialization-of-transformed-data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Analyze the graph
\item find frequent path 
\item materialize them
\item Discuss different criteria for materialization
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Execution frequency 
		\item Quality of the model
	\end{itemize}
\item Provide the mathematical formulation
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Materialization of Grid Search}
In order to analyze whether or not we should materialize parts of the grid search, we first have to unpack it, and compare it with other grid search.
Then, similar to Section \ref{sub-sec-materialization-of-transformed-data}, we materialize the parts that are executed frequently.

\subsection{Guided Grid-Search}
\todo[inline]{just an idea}
By extracting correlation between different parameters and the model quality we can provided a guided grid search, where we can provide some estimate or show the effects of a hyperparameter range on the model quality
