\section{Expert-to-Expert Knowledge Transfer} \label{sec-expert-expert}
Experts tend to use an standard set of transformations and models and parameters.

\subsection{Path Materialization}
Analyze the graph, find frequent path and materialize them.
Provide the mathematical formula.
Essentially, we would like to minimize the total 'compute' time by caching path of the graph with large weights.
We can provide the solution in case where we have limited storage or we provide a heuristic on what path to cache and what paths not to.

\subsection{Grid-Search Unpacking}
We discuss how to unpack grid search, and use the graph to find the path in the grid that are frequent.
Based on the assumption that experts have similar logic when designing the grids, there will be paths that could be materialized.

\subsection{Guided Grid-Search}
By extracting correlation between different parameters and the model quality we can provided a guided grid search, where we can provide some estimate or show the effects of a hyperparameter range on the model quality
