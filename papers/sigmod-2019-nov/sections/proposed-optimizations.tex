\subsection{Avoiding Local Optima}
Warm starting for bayesian optimization have the benefit of reducing the overhead of computing many trials.
However, inserting the data from the experiment database into the bayesian optimization search history may lead the search process into local optimas.
Specially, when the experiment database contain many hyperparameters that lead to very low error rate.
Subsequent search may focus on exploiting the areas that yield low loss and avoid exploring the space.
This is more prevalent is most of the search methods first start by exploring the space and as the search progresses they focus on exploiting the promising areas.
However, if the search history is already filled with many instances, the search process may focus solely on exploitation.
