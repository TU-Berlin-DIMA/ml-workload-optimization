\section{Evaluation} \label{sec-evaluation} 
In this section, we evaluate the performance of our collaborative optimizer system.
We focus on investigating the effect of our optimizations on the execution cost of workloads in collaborative environments.
We first describe the setup, including the hardware and the workloads we execute.
Then, we show the run-time improvement of our optimizer.
Then, we investigate the effect of the individual contributions, i.e., materialization and reuse algorithms, on the execution and storage cost.

\subsection{Setup}
\hl{We execute all the experiments on a server running Linux xxx with 128 GB of RAM and xxx GB of SSD.
We implement a prototype of our system in python 2.7 supporting both in-memory and disk-based Experiment Graph.
In the prototype, we implement the Experiment Graph using python's NetworkX library.
Unless specified otherwise, we run every experiment 5 times and report the average results (error bar included).}
We evaluate our proposed optimizations on two different sets of workloads.

\textbf{OpenML workloads.} In the OpenML workloads, we retrieve all the scikit-learn pipelines for task 31\footnote{https://www.openml.org/t/31}, i.e., classifying customers as good or bad credit risks using the German Credit data from the UCI repository \cite{asuncion2007uci}.

%\end{table}

\textbf{Kaggle workloads.} 
In the second set of workloads, we recreate the collaborative environment of the use case in Section \ref{sec-background}.
We introduced three workloads in the use case.
We retrieve two more workloads from the Kaggle competition, Home Credit Default Risk.
We also design 3 workloads based on the existing ones.
Table \ref{kaggle-workload} shows details of the workloads we utilize in our experiments.
The competition has 9 datasets with a total size of 2.5 GB\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data}.

\subsection{Execution Time}
\textbf{Kaggle Workloads.}
We start by showing the impact of our collaborative optimizer on the use case of Section \ref{sec-background}.
In the use case, we describe three workloads (Workloads 1-3 of Table \ref{kaggle-workload}).
Kaggle reports different users have copied and modified these workloads a total of 7000 times.
Therefore, at the very least, users execute these workloads 7000 times.
Figures \ref{exp-reuse-kaggle-same-workload} (a)-(c) show the result of repeating the execution of each workload.
The Experiment Graph is empty before the first run; therefore, both the baseline and our collaborative optimizer have the same run-time.
By materializing and reusing the artifacts, our collaborative optimizer reduces the run-time of the consecutive executions by one order of magnitude.
Workload 1 executes an external visualization command that plots a bivariate kernel density estimate, which incurs a large overhead.
Since our collaborative optimizer does not store the visualization information, it must re-execute the visualization command; thus, resulting in a smaller run-time reduction.

\label{exp-reuse-kaggle-same-workload}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{exp-reuse-kaggle-same-workload} (d) shows the cumulative run-time of executing the 8 workloads of Table \ref{kaggle-workload} one after another.
This corresponds to a real scenario, where after some scripts of a collaborative environment gain popularity, i.e., Workloads 1-3, other users modify and try to improve them, i.e., Workloads 4-8.
The figure shows that even running every workload once decreases the cumulative run-time reduction by half.
In a real collaborative environment, there are hundreds of more modified scripts and possibly thousands of repeated execution of these scripts, resulting in 1000s of hours of reduction in the cumulative run-time.

\subsection{Materialization}
In this experiment, we run the workloads of Table \ref{kaggle-workload} under different materialization budgets.
Figure \ref{exp-sa-vs-simple-size} shows the total run-time of all the workloads under different materialization budgets for the storage-aware and simple materialization algorithms.
\todo[inline]{There seems to be a bug reporting the result.}

\caption{Real size of the stored artifact for storage aware and simple materialization under different budgets \todo[inline]{add total size and a straight line for budget}}
\label{exp-sa-vs-simple-size}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{exp-sa-vs-simple-size} shows the real size of the stored artifacts under different budgets.
For the simple materialization algorithm, the maximum real size of the stored artifact never surpasses the budget.
However, in the storage-aware algorithm, we observe that the real size of the stored artifacts is 2 to 3 times more than the specified budget.
This shows that the rate of the duplicated columns in the artifacts of ML workloads is generally high.
Therefore, our storage-aware materialization algorithm can materialize more artifacts by de-duplicating the columns before storing them.

\textbf{Model Materialization. }
The goal of our materialization algorithm is to materialize high-quality models as soon as they appear in a new workload.
In this experiment, we run a typical scenario, where users always compare the score of their models with the score of the best performing model in the collaborative environment.
The OpenML platform assigns a time-stamp to every executed workload.
In this experiment, we execute all the OpenML workloads one by one and keep track of the best performing workload.
In every workload, as a post-processing step, we compare the score of the model with the score of the best performing model so far.

\subsection{Reuse and Warmstarting}
In this section, we compare our reuse algorithm we 2 baselines.
Baseline 1 loads every materialized artifact.
Baseline 2 re-computes every materialized artifacts and do not load them from EG.
\todo[inline]{Even for in-memory Experiment Graph, I expect our reuse perform better. Ideally, I'd like to also run the experiment when EG is stored on disk. I haven't implemented the on-disk Experiment Graph yet and may not be able to do it for SIGMOD.}

\subsection{Discussion}
%
%\subsubsection{Feature Processing Reuse}  
%In Figure \ref{evaluation-reuse-open-figure}, we show the effect of the reuse optimization on the OpenML workflow.
%The number of executed steps drastically decreases as the majority of the pipelines have the exact same data transformation steps and they only differ in the hyperparameters of the model (Figure \ref{evaluation-reuse-open-figure}a).
%However, Figure \ref{evaluation-reuse-open-figure}b shows that the reuse optimization does not impact the total execution time.
%This is specific to the OpenML use case, as the model training time dominates the data transformation time.
%\todo[inline]{The figure only shows estimates}

%\subsubsection{Model Warmstarting}
%In this experiment, we study the effect of the model warmstarting optimization on two pipelines (pipelines 5891 and 8568) from the openml database.
%Pipeline 5891 has a logistic regression model.
%There a total of 11 configurations in the database.
%The stopping condition for the logistic regression model is the convergence tolerance.
%Pipelines 8568 has random forest model.
%There are a total 555 configurations for pipelines 8568.
%The training of the random forest stops when the number of samples in any leaf node is below a user-defined threshold.
%
%Figure \ref{evaluation-warmstarting-figure} shows the result of the model warmstarting optimization on two types of models in the experiment database.
%Figures \ref{evaluation-warmstarting-figure}a and \ref{evaluation-warmstarting-figure}b shows the effect of warmstarting on the logistic regression model.
%Since the data size is small, the training time is fast and the total time is mostly dominated by the data processing and start-up time.
%To better show the effect of the warmstarting on the model training, we also include the total number of iterations for training the model on all 11 configurations.
%The warmstarting optimization reduces the number of iterations by a factor of three.
%Figure \ref{evaluation-warmstarting-figure}c shows the total training time for all the 555 random forest models.
%The warmstarting optimization reduces the total training time by one order of magnitude (from 300 seconds to 30 seconds).

%\subsubsection{Search Space Proposal}
%\subsubsection{Improved Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning}
%In this experiment, we focus on several of the popular machine learning pipelines (flow 7707, 8353, 8315) designed for solving task 31\footnote{https://www.openml.org/t/31}, classifying customers as good or bad credit risks using the German Credit data from the UCI repository \cite{Dua:2017}.
%We extracted the meta-data from the OpenML database which includes all the executions of the pipeline, the value of the hyperparameters, and the evaluation metrics.
%Using the meta-data, we initialize the hyperparameter optimization process with the values of the hyperparameters for each execution and the loss ($1- accuracy$) for the specific execution.
%We then execute the search with a budget of 100 trials, trying to minimize the loss of the OpenML pipelines.
%We repeat this experiment 10 times, for every pipeline.
%Figure \ref{fig-avg-warm-vs-cold-task-31} shows the average of losses of the 100 trials for the 10 experiments.
%Warm starting the search decreases the overall loss of the trials.

%\subsection{Avoiding Local Optima}
%
%\subsubsection{Adaptive Selection}
%In this experiment, we show the result of our adaptive selection methods on the hyperparameter search process.
%Figure \ref{fig-avg-adaptive-selection-task-31} shows the result of the histogram and random selection method on the hyperparameter search process.
%When compared to the vanilla approach (where full history is used in warmstarting), we see that random selection decrease the error rate of the trials where histogram increases them.
%To make the difference more visible we limit the scope of the loss (y axis) from 0.20 to 0.25.

%Figure \ref{figure-best-hyperparameters} shows the number of time that the search process (with budget of 100) manages to find the best set of hyperparameters that results in the lowest loss value.
%While both with and without warm starting does find the best set of hyperparameters, using warmstarting outperforms the search without wamrstarting and has a higher probability of finding the best hyperparameters.
